<p class="max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">This site serves as my developer portfolio and is written with Flask, Alpine, and Tailwind.</p>

<p class="max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">Flask was chosen because it's what I'm familiar with and it is more than sufficient for the task; this site's needs are barely more complicated than just serving static HTML, and it's not likely to see more than a few dozen concurrent viewers.</p>

<p class="max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">Alpine was chosen for similar reasons; this site isn't seriously limited by the "HTML with interaction on top" approach that using something like vanilla JavaScript or jQuery has. I find Alpine to be more ergonomic than those without inflating the client bundle to multiple megabytes in the way that React would likely do.</p>

<p class="max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl">I really dragged my feet on adding Tailwind, but the ability to use existing component libraries was something I couldn't ignore any longer.</p>
