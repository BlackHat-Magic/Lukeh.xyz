            </div>

            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">The Palladia Engine is a simple, ECS-based game engine written in C using the SDL GPU API. Currently, it only targets a Vulkan backend, but the goal is to at least also support WebGPU. Most of the code written so far is loosely based on the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/" target="_blank"class="hover:underline">Learn OpenGL tutorials</a>, at least as far as they can be for using an entirely different graphics API.</p>
            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">The project stemmed from a desire to learn graphics programming and the fact that, in game programming, I often find myself knowing exactly what I want the code to look like, but unsure of how to tell the game engine to do what I want. So I figured that several hundred hours of trial and error should save me thirty or so minutes of reading the Godot documentation.</p>

            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">The way this project came about is kind of funny. When I was doing my internship at NSHC in the summer of 2025, I was tasked with reading and creating a presentation on the <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/" target="_blank"class="hover:underline">Tiny C compiler</a> by Fabrice Bellard. Perhaps because of the language barrier, I had misinterpreted this as being to <em>write</em> a very simple compiler. I had gotten as far as writing a lexer and parser using a <a href="https://kuterdinel.com/writing-a-very-simple-jit-compiler-in-about-1000-lines-of-c.html" target="_blank" class="hover:underline">tutorial by Kuter Daniel</a> before the misunderstanding had been cleared up.</p>
            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">The compiler targets the RV64I instruction set for portability. The idea is that the compiled code will run in a virtual machine that executes the RISC-V instructions so that only the VM, not the runtime code, has to be recompiled for new platforms. This virtual machine is, of course, part of the project. As a part of preparing to write this project, I followed a <a href="https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/" target="_blank"class="hover:underline">tutorial by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton</a> detailing how to write a simple LC-3 virtual machine, and the RV64I VM would be based on that.</p>

            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">This site serves as my developer portfolio and is written with Flask, Alpine, and Tailwind.</p>
            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">Flask was chosen because it's what I'm familiar with and it is more than sufficient for the task; this site's needs are barely more complicated than just serving static HTML, and it's not likely to see more than a few dozen concurrent viewers.</p>
            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">Alpine was chosen for similar reasons; this site isn't seriously limited by the "HTML with interaction on top" approach that using something like vanilla JavaScript or jQuery has. I find Alpine to be more ergonomic than those without inflating the client bundle to multiple megabytes in the way that React would likely do.</p>
            <p class="prose max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground sm:text-xl mb-8">I really dragged my feet on adding Tailwind, but the ability to use existing component libraries was something I couldn't ignore any longer.</p>
